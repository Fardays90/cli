Blood Moon CLI â€“ A not-so-serious terminal companion.

Let's you:

See only the files in the directory you are in
Change directories
Sort files alphabetically or by modified time
You can also run system commands, but unsafe commands like:

rm, del, shutdown, reboot, chmod, chown
...are blocked for safety.

Feel free to make this better. Mainly made this to learn a few things about C.
