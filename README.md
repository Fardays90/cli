Blood Moon CLI, a not-so-serious terminal companion
Let's you see only the files in the directory you are in, change directories, sort the files alphabetically and according to the modified time. You could also run any system commands but unsafe commands like "rm", "del", "shutdown", "reboot", "chmod", "chown" are blocked.
Feel free to make this better. Mainly made this to learn a few things about C.
